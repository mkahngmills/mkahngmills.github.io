Through this process, I got to learn about spatial autocorrelation, cluster analysis, and other key elements of spatial epidemiology. By using different software and comparing the results, I was able to better understand how differences in packages that appear to serve the same function can produce different results. While understanding this study and its methods was really difficult for me as I am very unfamiliar with the majority of the concepts included, it was an engaging challenge that helped me grow in my ability to break down daunting tasks into more manageable pieces. In the future, I hope to learn more about spatial epidemiology and social vulnerability as they become increasingly important parts of our everyday lives.
