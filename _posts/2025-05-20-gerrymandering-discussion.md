In [this project](https://github.com/mkahngmills/OR-Gerrymander-Alabama), we analyzed the impact of using different metrics to analyze gerrymandering in Alabama's 2023 voting districts. Findings showed that convex hull and shapefile were more accurate measures of gerrymandering. This underscores the importance of robust research design. When we think about forking paths in analysis, it is often important to test multiple ways of analyzing a problem or measuring a phenomenon. This way, sources of bias and threats to validity can be identified and addressed.
