Through reproducing [Tuholske et al. study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-024-01293-y#Sec2), I learned about study design, working with climate raster and carceral facility data, iteration of data anlysis on large, multi-file datasets, and more!

While we were unable to replicate the full study, I was able to achieve a grasp of the exploratory study design, new r packages and techniques, and best practices for open science.

Most importantly, however, are the friends we made along the way. Big thank you to [Sam Barnard](https://padutchfan123.github.io) for working with me on this project. Additionally, we had the opportunity to poke around the author's website and learn about other [collaborations](https://sparklabnyc.github.io/site/home.html) and researchers in the field of geospatial science and public health.
