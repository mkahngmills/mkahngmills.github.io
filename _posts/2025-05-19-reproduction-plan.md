I am interested in reproducing

>Tuholske, C., Lynch, V.D., Spriggs, R. et al.
>Hazardous heat exposure among incarcerated people in the United States.
>Nat Sustain 7, 394–398 (2024).
>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-024-01293-y

because I am interested in how geospatial analysis can be used demonstrate harm and be used in broader struggles for justice. By reproducing this study, I hope to gain experience working with environmental justice and incarceration data.

Here is a link to our repository!
```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
